				<h2>Overview:</h2>
				<p>
					VUCMA (or, as it is sometimes written, VUCA) was created many years ago as a children's summer camp. Not much is known about VUCMA's time as a summer camp. Sometime between about 1920 and 1990 it made the transition from being a summer camp to being a slightly isolationist homeowners' association. Presumably someone knows how this change occurred, but I sure don't!
