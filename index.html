				<h2>Overview:</h2>
				<p>
					VUCMA (or, as it is sometimes written, VUCA) was created many years ago as a children's summer camp. Not much is known about VUCMA's time as a summer camp. Sometime between about 1920 and 1990 it made the transition from being a summer camp to being an overgrown homeowners' association. The association has no discernible purpose or mission statement, although there was a controversial attempt to install a statement of faith (one which may still be ongoing). Presumably there must be some sort of tax benefit to being an association and meeting annually, because VUCMA appears to run purely on inertia.

					If you've made it this far, you must realize that this website is made in jest and is not made to be taken seriously. VUCMA is ripe with things to make fun of, and I had to seize on that opportunity. Opinions in this website are those held by Aaron alone, unless marked otherwise.
